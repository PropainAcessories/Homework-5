🐔You wanted a day planner that showed the past in grey
    the present in red, and the future in green.

🐔 Most of the code was already provided minus the columns.
  
🐔 For those I wrote one and copied and pasted and changed a few numbers for
   the appropriate class.
 
🐔 The script was not too hard; I like how the use of this calls back the current
    DOM element. Made it much simpler.
